I am a Dermatology Resident at Hospital La Fe, Valencia. I am committed to advancing the field of dermatology through both clinical practice and research. My current focus is on innovative treatments for skin conditions, aiming to enhance patient care and outcomes. My residency has provided me with a robust foundation in both medical and aesthetic dermatology, allowing me to address a wide range of skin-related issues with expertise.

My research interests are broad, encompassing areas such as dermatopathology, photodermatology, and skin cancer. I have contributed to several significant studies, including investigations into the effects of UV radiation on skin health and the development of new diagnostic techniques for skin disorders. My work has been published in reputable journals, reflecting my dedication to pushing the boundaries of dermatological science. Through my research and clinical practice, I strive to improve the quality of life for my patients and contribute meaningfully to the research community.
