I am a Dermatology Resident at Hospital La Fe, Valencia, committed to advancing dermatology through both clinical practice and research. My current focus is on innovative treatments for skin conditions, aiming to enhance patient care and outcomes. My residency has provided me with a robust foundation in both medical and aesthetic dermatology, allowing me to address a wide range of skin-related issues with expertise.

My research interests are broad, spanning areas such as dermatopathology, photodermatology, and skin cancer. I have contributed to significant studies, including investigations into the effects of UV radiation on skin health and the development of new diagnostic techniques for skin disorders. My work has been published in reputable journals, reflecting my commitment to improving patient quality of life and contributing to the research community.

Before my residency, I practiced as a physician in Peru's Amazonas region and interned at Hospital Nacional Arzobispo Loayza in Lima. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s in Medicine from Universidad San Martin de Porres in Chiclayo, Peru. In my spare time, I enjoy swimming and playing video games.
